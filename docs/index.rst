sramongo User Documentation
====================================

sramongo is a python library and command line tool that queries NCBI's sequence
read archive(`SRA <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra>`_) and dumps all relevant
information into a mongo database. `Mongo <https://www.mongodb.com/>`_ is a
popular document based database, which stores information as ``key:value``
pairs; unlike a typical relational database (e.g., SQL) which stores data as
rows in multiple related tables. One major advantage of a document based
database to a relation database is that there is no need a defined schema;
attributes can be arbitrarily added or removed and don't need to be the
same across records. What this means is that you can run sra2mongo to query and
populate your database, then freely modify or add new fields/documents as part
of a processing pipeline.

Roughly speaking sramongo is made up of 3 parts. The first is a parser for SRA XML,
the second is an object relational mapper to allow easy interface with mongo,
and the third is a command line utility which uses Biopython and Entrez
utilities to query the SRA and download the resulting XML.

.. warning::
    Please use this tool responsibly, querying the SRA and dumping large amounts
    of data can be taxing on their system and may result in blacklisting of your
    IP address.
